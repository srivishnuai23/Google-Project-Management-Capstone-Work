Case: A resturant named Sauce and Spoon are installing tabletop tablet menus at the Downtown and North locations, with the tablets going live to guests on October 15. The following documents consist the relevent documents a project manager might make for this project.


# Executive Summary:

In order to reach annual growth and expansion goals, Sauce & Spoon installed tabletop tablet menus at the Downtown and North locations, with the tablets going live to guests on October 15. After sourcing and installing the tablets, training the staff, and a successful test run, we launched a pilot of the tablets, and gathered customer feedback through a survey that appeared on their devices at the end of their meal. Using that information, we implemented improvements to the operations, including continued waitstaff training, tablet audits to surface faulty devices, investigating instances of food waste, and more.
Now that we’ve officially launched the tablets, we’ve increased the average daily guest count by 10%, decreased wait time by 30 minutes, cut checkout time down to one minute, and decreased food waste by 50%. Sales have gone up upwards of 20% since the rollout. Customer satisfaction has also increased from 72% after the initial pilot to 86% today. This, of course, shows us that there’s still room for improvement, which we will continue to make as we explore rolling out tablets to other Sauce & Spoon locations in the near future.
